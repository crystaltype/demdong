Â Dem dong - retro Vietnamese script typeface

Crystal Type began this project in 2021 as a part of the Google Font project. The typeface is a revival of retro Vietnamese script typefaces from the 1950s. A large part of these retro typefaces was drawn by local sign painters, as well as book/cd cover artists.

Those authentic hand-painted signs that once appeared throughout Ho Chi Minh city has slowly given way to cheap, laser print banners that look exactly like each other.
This project is an attempt of reviving authentic and original retro Vietnamese typefaces that were lost through time.
